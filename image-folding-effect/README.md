### HTML Code

- First, we create an HTML file (index.html).
- Then we link the CSS file that provides all the animation's effect to our HTML. It is also placed inside <head> tag.
- Coming to the body section of our HTML code.
  - Firstly, we are giving heading to our page.
  - Then, we have to create an unordered list in which we have 5 list items that are further used to store the image.

### CSS Code

CSS is used to give different types of animations and effects to our HTML page so that it looks interactive to all users.

- Restore all the browser effects.
- Use classes and ids to give effects to HTML elements.
- Use of **nth-child() selector property** to give different styles to different list items.
- The **:nth-child() CSS pseudo-class selector** is useful for targeting elements based on their position among siblings. This selector can match elements by specific numeric positions, odd/even positions, or complex functional notations like An+B.
