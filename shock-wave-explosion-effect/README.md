## Shock Wave and Explosion Effect

This is totally from GeeksForGeeks.org HTML and CSS tutorials.
<br />

The pseudo-element that we are using is **hover**.
<br />

### HTML Code

- Create a normal structure where we use the explosion or shock wave effect.

### CSS Code

- The first step is to aligning our div to the center of the page using **flexbox**
- Then we have to create a circle using **border-radius property**. We have increased the value of it's offset at every step.
- Then we will use a **transition duration** to the div.
- Now use **hover selector** and copy and paste the **box-shadow property** which we used earlier and increased it's offset value.
- We have increased its value so that on hover it feels like coming out of the center(explosion effect). You can play with the color of the box-shadow to have a different or even multiple color explosion.
