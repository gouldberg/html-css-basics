### HTML Code

- First, we create an HTML file(index.html).
- After creating the HTML file, we are going to give a title to our webpage using the <title> tag. It should be placed inside the <head> tag.
- Then we link the CSS file that provides all the animations effect to our HTML. It is also placed inside the <head> tag.
- Coming to the body section of our HTML code.
  - Firstly, we are giving a heading to our page.
  - Inside the heading create 3 **span to store the data**.

### CSS Code

- Use of **nth-child() selector property** to give different styles to different span items.
- The **:nth-child() CSS pseudo-class selector** is useful for targeting elements based on their position among siblings. This selector can match elements by specific numeric positions, odd/even positions, or complex functional notations like An+B.
