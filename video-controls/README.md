## Video Control: Autoplay, Poster

This is totally from GeeksForGeeks.org HTML and CSS tutorials.
<br />

The HTML \<video\> controls attribute is used to display video controls in HTML5. It is the Boolean value. HTML5 most commonly uses ogg, mp4, ogm and ogv as a video formats in the video tag because the browser support for them differs.
<br />

Note: Always specify the width and height of the video else web page will be confused that how much space the video will be required due to the reason the web page becomes slow down.
